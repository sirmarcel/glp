"""neighborlist.py

The role of a neighborlist implementation is to reduce the amount of pairs
of atoms to consider from N*N to something linear in N by removing pairs
that are farther away than a given cutoff radius.

This file implements this in a naive way: We first generate all N*N combinations,
and then trim down these candidates into a fixed number of pairs. Once that number
is decided, this procedure is jittable. The initial allocation is not.

The general data format consists of two index arrays, such that the indices in
`centers` contains the atom from which atom-pair vectors originate, while the
`others` contains the index which receives a given atom-pair vector.

The overall design of this is heavily inspired by jax-md by Samuel Schoenholz.
